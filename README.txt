##Summary

The Flipkey modules uses xml feeds from flipkey.com to generate theme-able reviews on your site! Includes average rating and ratings for individual reviews.

##How It works

Queries a flipkey feed for reviews, and return the results in a template file, flipkey-widget.tpl.php

You can override the template file in your own theme or preprocess by using function mytheme_preprocess_flipkey_widget

##Notes on Compatibility

There are no compatibility issues, only that this uses PH5 and simplexml.

##Limitations

The only limitations are what data is provided by the flipkey xml service.

##Dependencies

Flipkey Front Desk key and a valid flip key account.

##Road Map

@todo - figure out if anything else needs to be done!

##Contacting the Maintainer of This project

Please feel free to contact me via github or drupal.org. My handle is "kirikintha" it's easy to find me. Support requests should allow between 3-5 business days, and I have to reserve the right to push off new features to the next version. My plan is to have quarterly releases, unless there is an emergency bug that crashes everything, which I will do my best to resolve as quickly as I can.

Thank you very much for using my module, I hope it works for you bug free!
